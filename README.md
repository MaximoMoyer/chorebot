# Summary #

Proof of concept application that pulls from an automatically updating google sheet and sends a text to each of my roomates every week with their chores for the week.

[Google Sheet that autoupdates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GH7gVxLvOTsPCRUDu72pJaJuAgR9PDef__m9waPXWuo/edit#gid=896179141) in case you want to recreate.

Will be building out into a full web app that others can use.
