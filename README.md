# Summary #

Proof of concept application that pulls from an automatically updating google sheet and sends a text to each of my roomates every week with their chores for the week. Job is run every week using a cron job

[Google Sheet that autoupdates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GH7gVxLvOTsPCRUDu72pJaJuAgR9PDef__m9waPXWuo/edit#gid=896179141) and instructions to [cron job](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57590550/i-want-the-cron-job-to-run-the-script-weekly-basis) in case you want to recreate.
